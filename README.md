# StarterKit

This is my gulp starter kit based on a [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/) by Zell Liew

It has the file structure of
  |- app/
      |- css/
      |- fonts/
      |- images/ 
      |- index.html
      |- js/ 
      |- scss/
  |- dist/
  |- gulpfile.js
  |- node_modules/
  |- package.json

To use gulp you will need to install node.js [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

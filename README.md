# StarterKit

This is my gulp starter kit based on a [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/) by Zell Liew

It will need a file structure of
```
|- app/
    |- css/
    |- fonts/
    |- images/ 
    |- index.html
    |- js/ 
    |- scss/
        |- Base/
        |- Component/
        |- Page/
        |- Partial/
        |- Tools/
|- dist/
|- gulpfile.js
|- node_modules/
|- package.json
```
To use gulp you will need to install node.js [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
